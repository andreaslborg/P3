<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With the growing use of technology and with 90%
of the Danish population having access to a smart-
phone it would seem useful to replace physical
elements with software solutions was new innova-
tions and ideas arise. The purpose of this project
is to develop a dynamic and flexible digital infor-
mation board, with the ability to easily change
the information on the visitor application using
an administration panel. These digital informa-
tion boards can both replace physical information
boards and be an addition to any company seeking
to share information. The development process
is done in collaboration with talDigital and with
the utilisation of design guidelines presented in SU
and DEB. Furthermore, the software solution was
created by using the following technologies; pro-
gressive web application, Blazor, Bootstrap and
MySQL. The solution consists of two web pages,
the visitor application and the administrator panel.
The visitor application is developed to be viewed
on a mobile device and is concluded by test par-
ticipants as intuitive to use. The administrator
panel is developed to be viewed on a larger screen,
such as a laptop or desktop, and tested to be intu-
itive and easy to use. The solution is successful in
giving a dynamic digital information board with
an administrator panel and is considered a useful
proof-of-concept for talDigital.
